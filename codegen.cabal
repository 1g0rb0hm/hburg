Synopsis:       Haskell Bottom Up Rewrite Generator
Description:    HBURG has been designed to produce a
	code generator for a target machine, given a specification
	of an abstract syntax tree of a program as well as a 
	specification of the target machine itself.
	Its goals are the following:
	.
	* Provide a powerful tree pattern matching specification 
	language with simplicity and easy readability in mind.
	.
	* Perform good static analysis aiding during the design of
	grammar specifications.
	.
	* Provide back-ends which generate code for various languages
	from the specification, ready to be plugged into a back-end
	compiler infrastructure. Currently Java Code is being generated
	(see http://www.bytelabs.org/hburg.html for an example on how
	to integrate the generated code into a compiler).
